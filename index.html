                <p> It was a very long and hard competition the object of the game was that you had two months to read books given by the organizers of the event and then after you read the books the schools would compete and the judges would ask them questions about one of the books and then switch to another book and whichever school got the most correct questions they would win and Holy Trinity won the event a couple of times.

                <p> Its takes a couple of days to do the Spelling Bee but classmates would go up against classmates and compete in a spelling bee against each other.

                <p> The day before Field Day teachers assign you with other students in different grades and they randomize it but the 8th graders don't do Field Day because they organize Field Day but its fair because they get 1 week extra of Summer Break then everyone else does. So the teachers tell you to wear a color it can either be on your shirt, pant, shoes, or even bandana and then you get to play really fun games for half of the day like tug of war, dodgeball, capture the flag, and many more and everyone enjoys it because its so much fun.

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> Since the school raised a lot of money the staff and principal wanted to repay them so they decided to add 5 new things to the playground the items they added are listed here. They added a gaga ball pit which the objective of the game is to hit the ball and try to hit the other players feet, they also added a 
                little kids swing which was for pre k - 1st because it was hard to ride on the normal swings for them. They also added a music stand where you can hit the drums, I question why they put a weird turtle looking structure on the playground but they did and nobody knows why, and last but not the least they bought a couple of basketball hoops so you could play basketball outside with your friends.

Now the music teacher teaches all of the students how to play the instruments. Its very fun!
